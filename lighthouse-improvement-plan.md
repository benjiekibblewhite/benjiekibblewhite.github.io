# Lighthouse Improvement Plan

## Current Scores (April 16, 2025)

- **Performance**: 72/100
- **Accessibility**: 93/100
- **Best Practices**: 96/100
- **SEO**: Good (specific score not displayed)

## Performance Improvement Plan

### Critical Issues

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Score 0.02

   - Current LCP: 8.4s (needs to be under 2.5s for good score)
   - Actions:
     - Convert images to next-gen formats (WebP/AVIF)
     - Properly size images (potential savings of 1,024 KiB)
     - Preload LCP image in the HTML head
     - Avoid lazy-loading for above-the-fold images

2. **JavaScript Optimization**:

   - Minify JavaScript (potential savings of 38 KiB)
   - Reduce unused JavaScript (potential savings of 62 KiB)
   - Avoid serving legacy JavaScript to modern browsers

3. **Resource Delivery**:
   - Enable text compression (potential savings of 114 KiB)
   - Implement efficient cache policies for static assets
   - Eliminate render-blocking resources

### Accessibility Improvements

1. **Image Alt Text**:

   - Add descriptive alt attributes to all images
   - This is the main accessibility issue affecting your score

2. **Image Aspect Ratio**:
   - Fix images that display with incorrect aspect ratio

### Best Practices Improvements

1. **Back/Forward Cache**:
   - Fix the one failure reason preventing bfcache restoration
   - This will improve navigation experience when users click back/forward

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Image Optimization

```bash
# Install image optimization tools
npm install --save-dev imagemin imagemin-webp

# Create a script to convert and optimize images
# Add to your build process
```

### 2. JavaScript Optimization

```bash
# Add minification to your build process
npm install --save-dev terser

# Update build.js to include minification
```

### 3. Server Configuration

- Enable Gzip/Brotli compression
- Set up proper cache headers for static assets
- Consider implementing a CDN for better delivery

### 4. HTML Improvements

- Add preload hints for critical resources
- Fix image alt attributes
- Ensure all images have proper width and height attributes

## Next Steps

1. Focus first on image optimization as this will have the biggest impact on your Performance score
2. Add alt text to images to address the major Accessibility issue
3. Implement text compression for quick performance wins
4. Optimize JavaScript usage and loading

This plan addresses the most critical issues that are affecting your Lighthouse scores. After implementation, run another Lighthouse audit to measure improvements.
