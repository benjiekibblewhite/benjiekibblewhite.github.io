Goal: Create a gallery page for each photo set. The Gallery should display some of the metadata for the photos, and the description, on the left side of the page. The photos will be displayed on the right.

We should first display the photos in a grid. When a user clicks on a photo, we should display the full photo in a modal.

The modal should display the full photo, the file name of the photo, and a link to the original photo. There should be controls that appear to navigate to the next and previous photos.

We should also create an index page that lists all the gallery pages. We can use the createIndexPage as a starting point.

The photos are store in the ./photos directory. There will be folders for each photo set. Each folder will contain the image files and an index.md file. The .md will have the metadata for the image, and some markdown text with a description.
