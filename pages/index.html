      Hey, I'm Benjie! I love the web. I grew up on it. I love building things
      on it, and I believe in it. This is my little corner of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I write a bit about my work, share thoughts on accessibility, random
      internet finds, and my photography.
    </p>
    <p>This is a work in progress.</p>

    <p>
      I'm not currently looking for work, so the lack of polish is just fine by
      me. This is my online home, not a product. It changes as I see fit, when I
      decide to work on it, purely for The Love Of The Game.
