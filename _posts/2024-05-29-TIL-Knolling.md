**Knolling**: The process of arranging objects so they are parallel or at 90-degree angles.

So I guess this was a big instagram trend a few years ago. I've always seen tons of images like this, usually people showing off their Every Day Carry, or for marketing pictures. But it's a new term to me, which I found while reading the wiki page for [Everyday Carry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyday_carry). There's some neat history on the origin on the practice and word on [Tom Sach's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Sachs#Knolling) page. I have no insights about it, I was just gobsmacked there was a word for it in the first place!
